description:You will learn how to do simple math formuluas: supscripts, superscripts, series and sums, integrals, derivatives, etc.
---

title:Symbols
---
id:1
---
target: $\alpha + \beta + \gamma = \pi$
---
hint:
---
comment: Write source code for the formula above. Enclose it in dollar
signs: \dollar MATH HERE \dollar. Use \bs{alpha} for $\alpha$, and so on.
---

title:Integrals
---
id:1.1
---
target: $$\int x dx$$
---
hint:
---
comment: Now write code for the integral above. You will need \code{\bs{int}} for $\int$.  Snippets of LaTeX code like \code{\bs{int}}  are called \italic{macros}.

This time, put your LaTeX code betwen double dollar signs: \dollar\dollar MATH HERE \dollar\dollar.  This is \italic{display math mode}.
---

title:Spacing
---
id:1.2
---
target: $$\int x\ dx$$
---
hint:
---
comment: Sometimes you need to adjust the spacing.  If you put \code{\bs{space}}
between the \code{x} and the \code{dx}, the formula will look better. You can also put a backslash followed by a space.
---

title:Superscripts
---
id:2
---
target:Pythagoras said that $ a^2 + b^2 = c^2 $
---
hint:
---
comment:Use \code{^} for superscripts, e.g, \code{x^2} for $x^2$. Notice the form: ordinary text, with the mathematics between dollar signs. This is \italic{inline math mode} once again.
---

title:Superscripts and Integrals
---
id:2.1
---
target:$$
\int x^2 dx
$$
---
hint:
---
comment:You know what to do here!  Combine what you know about symbols
with what you know about superscripts. This is \italic{display math mode} once again.
---


title:Fractions
---
id:2.2
---
target:$$
\int x^2 dx = \frac{x^3}{3} + C
$$
---
hint:
---
comment: You will need to use the \code{\bs{frac}} macro.  It works
like this: \code{\bs{frac}\texarg{numerator}\texarg{denomianator}}. If
you don't like the looks of the result, try putting the macro \code{\bs{small}} just before the \code{\bs{frac}}.
---

title:Derivatives
---
id:2.3
---
target:$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = y
$$
---
hint:
---
comment: You can use fractions to make derivatives.
---

title: Second derivatives
---
id:2.3
---
target:$$
\frac{d^2y}{d^2x} = -k y
$$
---
hint:
---
comment: You can use fractions and superscripts to make second derivatives.
---

title: Partial derivatives
---
id:2.4
---
target:$$
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} 
$$
---
hint:
---
comment: Here you need to know that \code{\bs{partial}} makes this: $\partial$.
---


title:On and on
---
id:3.1
---
target:$$
a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots
$$
---
hint:Use \code{_} for subscripts, e.g., \code{a_1} for $a_1$.
---
comment:The macro \code{\ldots} puts three dots along the baseline. A
related macro is \code{\bs{cdots}}, which puts dots centere in the line, above the baseline.
